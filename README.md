## Technical Details

ClipboardManager uses:
- `rumps` to create the macOS menu bar application
- `pyperclip` to interact with the clipboard
- `NSPasteboard` from Foundation to efficiently monitor clipboard changes
- Threading to ensure responsive performance
- Adaptive sleep times to minimize resource usage

The application limits clipboard entries to 10,000 characters for display and storage efficiency.

## Limitations

- Only tracks text content (not images or files)
- Maximum history of 10 items
- Text entries longer than 10,000 characters are truncated for storage
- Menu display shows only the first 47 characters of long entries
